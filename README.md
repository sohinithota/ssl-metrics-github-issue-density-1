## About

The Software Systems Laboratory (SSL) GitHub Issue Density Project is a `python` tool to calculate the issue density of a GitHub repository. It is reliant upon the output of the [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/SoftwareSystemsLaboratory/ssl-metrics-github-issues) and [Git Commits](https://github.com/SoftwareSystemsLaboratory/ssl-metrics-git-commits-loc) tools.

This project is licensed under the BSD-3-Clause. See the [LICENSE](LICENSE) for more information.

## Developer Tooling

To maximize the utility of this project and the greater SSL Metrics project, the following software packages are **required**:

### Operating System

All tools developed for the greater SSL Metrics project **must target** Mac OS and Linux. SSL Metrics software is not supported or recommended to run on Windows *but can be modified to do so at your own risk*.

It is recomendded to develop on Mac OS or Linux. However, if you are on a Windows machine, you can use WSL to develop as well.
### Shell Software

#### Required Shell Software

- `git`

#### Optional Shell Software

For reasons why you might want to install this software, see the [Parallel Execution](#parallel-execution) section.

- `parallel`

### Python Software

All listed Python software assumes that you have downloaded and installed **Python 3.9.6** or greater.

- `ssl-metrics-meta`

You can install the Python software with this one-liner:

`pip install --upgrade pip ssl-metrics-meta`


## How To Use

### Installation

You can install the tool via `pip` with either of the two following one-liners:

- `pip install --upgrade pip ssl-metrics-meta`
- `pip install --upgrade pip ssl-metrics-github-issue-density`

### Command Line Arguements

`ssl-metrics-github-issue-density-compute -h`

```shell
options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -c COMMITS, --commits COMMITS
                        Commits JSON file
  -i ISSUES, --issues ISSUES
                        Issues JSON file
  -o OUTPUT, --output OUTPUT
                        output JSON file
```

`ssl-metrics-github-issue-density-graph -h`

```shell
options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -i INPUT, --input INPUT
                        The input data file that will be read to create the graphs
  -o OUTPUT, --output OUTPUT
                        The filename to output the bus factor graph to
  -m MAXIMUM_DEGREE_POLYNOMIAL, --maximum-degree-polynomial MAXIMUM_DEGREE_POLYNOMIAL
                        Estimated maximum degree of polynomial
  -r REPOSITORY_NAME, --repository-name REPOSITORY_NAME
                        Name of the repository that is being analyzed
  --x-window-min X_WINDOW_MIN
                        The smallest x value that will be plotted
  --x-window-max X_WINDOW_MAX
                        The largest x value that will be plotted
```
